🐾 Animal Species Classification using CNN

📌 Overview

"Animal Species Classification using CNN" is a deep learning project that classifies images of animals into their respective species.
The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), trained on a dataset containing images of animals such as bears, crows, rats, and elephants.


This project demonstrates the power of CNNs in extracting visual features like shapes, textures, and patterns from images and accurately predicting the animal species.
A web interface is integrated with the model, allowing users to upload an image and get instant classification results.
